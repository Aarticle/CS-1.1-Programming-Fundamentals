# MadLibs Project

## Description
Let's build something fun and silly! :-) Let's make a MadLibs game that generates sentences that sound realistic, but not always sensible.

## Requirements
* Variable assignment
* Function definitions
* Core data types: strings, integers, floats
* Collection types: lists, tuples, dictionary
* The system module (for accessing command-line arguments)
* The random module (for generating random numbers/words)
* Place words into a sentence, and view the result as output
