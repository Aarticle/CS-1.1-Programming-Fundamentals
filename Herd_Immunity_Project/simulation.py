class Simulation(object):
    '''
    Main class that will run the herd immunity simulation program.  Expects initialization
    parameters passed as command line arguments when file is run.

    Simulates the spread of a virus through a given population.  The percentage of the
    population that are vaccinated, the size of the population, and the amount of initially
    infected people in a population are all variables that can be set when the program is run.

    _____Attributes______

    logger: Logger object.  The helper object that will be responsible for writing
    all logs to the simulation.

    population_size: Int.  The size of the population for this simulation.

    population: [Person].  A list of person objects representing all people in
        the population.

    next_person_id: Int.  The next available id value for all created person objects.
        Each person should have a unique _id value.

    virus_name: String.  The name of the virus for the simulation.  This will be passed
    to the Virus object upon instantiation.

    mortality_rate: Float between 0 and 1.  This will be passed
    to the Virus object upon instantiation.

    basic_repro_num: Float between 0 and 1.   This will be passed
    to the Virus object upon instantiation.

    vacc_percentage: Float between 0 and 1.  Represents the total percentage of population
        vaccinated for the given simulation.

    current_infected: Int.  The number of currently people in the population currently
        infected with the disease in the simulation.

    total_infected: Int.  The running total of people that have been infected since the
    simulation began, including any people currently infected.

    total_dead: Int.  The number of people that have died as a result of the infection
        during this simulation.  Starts at zero.


    _____Methods_____

    __init__(population_size, vacc_percentage, virus_name, mortality_rate,
     basic_repro_num, initial_infected=1):
        -- All arguments will be passed as command-line arguments when the file is run.
        -- After setting values for attributes, calls self._create_population() in order
            to create the population array that will be used for this simulation.

    _create_population(self, initial_infected):
        -- Expects initial_infected as an Int.
        -- Should be called only once, at the end of the __init__ method.
        -- Stores all newly created Person objects in a local variable, population.
        -- Creates all infected person objects first.  Each time a new one is created,
            increments infected_count variable by 1.
        -- Once all infected person objects are created, begins creating healthy
            person objects.  To decide if a person is vaccinated or not, generates
            a random number between 0 and 1.  If that number is smaller than
            self.vacc_percentage, new person object will be created with is_vaccinated
            set to True.  Otherwise, is_vaccinated will be set to False.
        -- Once len(population) is the same as self.population_size, returns population.
