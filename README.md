# Product College Course Template 

This is template for creating a written record of your course material for PC.

These should be complete courses taught at the PC. Tutorials or other resources 
should either be created as tutorials (see below) or added to Product College labs if 
it is another type of resource. 

## Use the Course Template

Use the course [course-template](./course-template.md) as a starting point for your 
putting your course on the Product College Github. 

**Please follow this template! This is important for BPPE compliance.**

Everything not marked *optional* should be included in the top level README in the 
Github repo. 

- [course-template](./course-template.md)

### Use Markdown

Write your class using Markdown. Follow the structure of the course template. Make
sensible use of Headings, Lists, and other mark up. 

#### Tips

Use Headings in order! Only one H1 heading per page. For example the page might start 
with an H1, the next heading will be an H2, if another sub topic appears that needs a 
heading use an H3. When the next new topic appears it is an H2. 

## Post to Product College Github

Write your courses and post them to the product college Github.
Courses should be posted to 'Product College Classes'.

If your class needs to link to large and complex sample/starter projects post these 
to 'Product College Labs'. Small sample files can be included in the main class 
repository.
